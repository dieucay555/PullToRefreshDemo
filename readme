-----------Note For Pulltorefresh Demo-----------

1, the project can not find class ViewPager but you has put the v4 jar in folder libs.

   caused by:
   
             the v4 jar is not packed in apk

   solution:  
   
             1-1 enter Java Build Path
             1-2 select the fouth category: Order and Exclude
             1-3 selcet the v4 jar (in Android private Library)
             


2, can not cast from Fragment to PullToRefreshListFragment

   caused by:
   
              if you use v4 jar, there are two Fragment, one is android.app.ListFragment, one is android.support.v4.app.ListFragment.
              
  solution:
  
              include the android.support.v4.app.ListFragment
